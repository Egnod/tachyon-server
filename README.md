## Running tests

If you want to run it in docker, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . run --rm api pytest -vv .
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . down
```

For running tests on your local machine.
1. you need to start a database.

I prefer doing it with docker:
```
docker run -p "5432:5432" -e "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=tachyon" -e "POSTGRES_USER=tachyon" -e "POSTGRES_DB=tachyon" postgres:13.4-buster
```


2. Run the pytest.
```bash
pytest -vv .
```
